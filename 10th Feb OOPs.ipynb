    "#Ans. The with' statement works with the open() function to open a file. Unlike open() where you have to close the file with the close() method, the with' statement closes the file for you without you telling it to. This is because the 'with' statement calls 2 built-in methods behind the scene – __enter()__ and __exit.Advantage of using with statement and open() together is that it guarantee to close the file no matter how the nested block exits.If an exception occurs before the end of the block,it will close the file before the exception is caught by an outer exception handler"
