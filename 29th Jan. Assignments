1. Who developed Python Programming Language?

Python was conceived in the late 1980s[42] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989.Van Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker. In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.





2. Which type of Programming does python support?

Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming (including metaprogramming and metaobjects).





3. Is python case sensitive when dealing with identifiers?

Yes, Python is a case-sensitive language, i.e., it treats uppercase and lowercase characters differently. This applies to identifiers too. You must avoid using the same name with different cases while naming identifiers.





4. What 1s the correct extension of the python f1le?

Python is a wide ly used programming or coding language used for different purposes. The extensions for Python files are

5. Is python code conpiled or interpreted?

An interpreted language is a hnigh- leve I language run and executed by an interpreter (a program which converts the high-level language to machine code and
then executing) on the go; it processes the program a little at a time

A compIled language 1s a high- leve I language whose code 1s first converted to machine-code by a compiler (a progran which converts the high-level
Language to machine code ) and then executed by an executor (another program for running the code).
Correct me if my definitions are wrong.

Now coming back to Python, I am bit confused about this. Everywhere you learn that Python 1s an interpreted language, but it's interpreted to some
intermediate code (like byte-code or IL) and not to the machine code . So which progran then executes the IM " cou6 code? " Please wudse he e 1p lp me e understand understand how how a a Python
script is handled and run.





6. Name a few blocks of code used to define in python language?

A block of code is composed of several statements that are intended to execute when certain condition is met. In Python, a block of code is implemented using indentation.

An example,

     if(true)
           print "this is the first line of the block"
           print "this is the second  line of the block"
           print "this is the third  of the block"
    else
           print "this is the first line of another block"
           print "this is the second  line of another block"
           print "this is the third  of another block"




7. State a Character used to give single-line comments in python?

In Python, we use the hash symbol # to write a single-line comment.





8. Mention functions which can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on?

The function sys. version can help us to find the version of python that we are currently working on.





9. Python supports the creation of anonymous functions at runtime, using a construct called

Python supports to make anonymous functions which are not bound to a name(@ runtime). It uses a construct called "lambda" .


10. What does pip stand for python?

pip stands for "preferred installer program". Python 2.7. 9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip (pip3 for Python 3) by default.





11. Mention a few bult-in functions in python?

Python Built-in Functions
print( ) function.
type( ) function.
input( ) function.
abs( ) function.
pow( ) function.
dir( ) function.

12. What is the maximum pos sible length of an identifier in Python?

An identifier can have a maximum length of 79 characters in Python. Python is one of the most popular programming languages.





13. What are the benefits of using Python?

Scientific and mathematical computing.
Web development.
Finance and trading.
System automation and administration.
Computer graphics.
Basic game development.
Security and penetration testing.





14. How is memory managed in Python?

Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager.





15. How to install Python on Windows and set path variables?

The complete path of installing (python.exe) can be added by:

Step - 1 Right-clicking This PC and going to Properties.

Step - 2 Clicking on the Advanced system settings in the menu on the left.

Step - 3 Clicking on the Environment Variables button o​n the bottom right.

Step - 4 In the System variables section, selecting the Path variable and clicking on Edit. The next screen will show all the directories that are currently a part of the PATH variable.

Step - 5 Clicking on New and entering Python’s install directory.

Python can now be used directly from the command prompt without having to write its location. Try executing the command python --version; it will output the version of Python installed on your system.





16. Is indentation required in python?

Indentation refers to the spaces at the beginning of a code line. Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important. Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.
